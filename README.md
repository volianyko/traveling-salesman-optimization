# TSP Visualizer — ACO vs SA (plus Held–Karp)

This is a tiny, interactive playground for the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. You can:

- Generate a random set of cities
- Tweak algorithm input parameters
- Watch algorithms solutions evolve
- Compare **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**, **Simulated Annealing (SA)**, and an **exact Held–Karp** baseline (for small *n*)

---

## What you’ll see

- A **start page** with a big “start” button
- A **main page** where you can:
  - pick the number of **cities** and **generate** a graph
  - change the graph by dragging cities around
  - add cities by clicking on the graph
  - set parameters for ACO and SA
  - play/pause, speed up/slower playback
  - hide/show each algorithm’s best path
  - clear the canvas and try again
