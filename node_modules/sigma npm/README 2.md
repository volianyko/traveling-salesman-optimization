# Sigma.js

[Sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org) is an open-source JavaScript library aimed at visualizing graphs of thousands of nodes and edges, mainly developed by [@jacomyal](https://github.com/jacomyal) and [@Yomguithereal](https://github.com/Yomguithereal).

## Overview

Here are some quick insights on the codebase. To know more on these topics, please read the [documentation](https://sigmajs.org/docs).

### Architecture

Since version `v2`, sigma.js focuses on the management of graph display: rendering, interaction... The graph model is managed in a separate library called **[graphology](https://github.com/graphology/graphology)**, which is packed with convenience methods to manage graph data structures, and a lot of satellite libraries to handle various graph-related problems (metrics, community detection, layout algorithms...).

Graphology website offers [a list](https://graphology.github.io/standard-library/) of these libraries. Most of them can help you solve problems in your sigma.js based web applications.

### Rendering

Sigma.js uses **WebGL** to render graphs. This makes it good at rendering medium to larger graphs in web pages (thousands of nodes and edges or more). It is also possible to customize rendering, but it is harder than it would be with SVG or Canvas based solutions.

Each way to draw a node or an edge is implemented as a `program`. You can develop your own, or use the owns provided by sigma. You can check [this example](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/examples/custom-rendering/index.ts) to see how to use multiple programs. Also, you can check the list of available programs [here](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/sigma/src/rendering/webgl/programs).

## Installation

You can install `sigma` (and `graphology` which is required for `sigma` to work) in your JavaScript or TypeScript project using `npm`:

```bash
npm install graphology sigma
```

## Examples

The [`examples`](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/examples) folder contains a series of self-contained TypeScript projects that you can either browse and edit on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or install locally likewise:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jacomyal/sigma.js.git
cd sigma.js
npm install
cd packages/examples
npm start --example=load-gexf-file # Change this to the desired example
```

Also, a more realistic sigma.js based web application is available in the [`demo`](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/demo) folder. It aims to show a real-world usecase, and is the main showcase of [sigma.js website](https://www.sigmajs.org/).

## Testing

Some minor helpers are unit tested, but the main way sigma.js is tested is with generated screenshots. Those screenshots are generated with [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) on a headless Chrome/Chromium. Also, there are now some benchmarking scenarii, to ensure some features do not bring a bad impact on performances.

You can check that everything is fine (unit tests and screenshots) by simply running:

```bash
npm run test
```

If at some point, you actually have a good reason to break some screenshots, you can run `npm run e2e:generate-screenshots` to erase reference screenshots.

## Benchmarking

You can run the benchmark scenarii by running:

```bash
cd path/to/sigma.js
cd packages/sigma
npm run e2e:benchmark -- --filename my-report.json
```

This will generate a JSON report at `test/e2e/reports/my-report.json`.

Then, you can compare it to some reference report, by running:

```bash
cd path/to/sigma.js
cd packages/sigma
npm run e2e:compare-benchmarks -- --reference test/e2e/reports/reference-report.json --report test/e2e/reports/my-report.json
```

## Website

The current website is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), with a static homepage. It is located in the `website` folder. It also showcases the React.js based demo available in the [`demo`](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/demo) folder in an iframe. The website itself does not need any build step, though the demo does.

The homepage and identity have been kindly designed by [Robin de Mourat](https://github.com/robindemourat/) from the [Sciences-Po m√©dialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/) team.

Read the dedicated [README](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/website) to know more on how to build it.
